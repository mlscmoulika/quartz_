Learning is a ever evolving process. We learn something every day, useful or useless at that moment doesn't matter, but we keep going. And one day when we stumble upon people who know a little tiny more than us, it is very easy to feel uneasy and snuggle back into the shell of our comfort zone. Which probably does give us some time to separate ourselves from the problem, and try to think of a way to deal with it. But are we happy about us zoning out or moving into our cocoon? Well I would say, at least from my experience, no.. But I would also want to add that the moments like that, if looked at with curiosity, help us to take it positively, and learn and grow. May be all of you already know what I am talking about. Some might not know, well whatever is the case, navigate to a section of your choice and explore.
