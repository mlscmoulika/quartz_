I visited HAL on 24-11-24. This place also has a simulator, which was under maintainance when I visited. The price for the museum was decent and got an opportunity to learn interesting things about HAL.
- HAL (Hindhusthan Aeronautical Limited), was established by Warchand Hirachand, before independence. 
- There were pictures of a lot of ministers across the world visiting and talking about it.
- One person from HAL also designed Car, and HAL had Rolls Royce and Jaguar collaborations. Which means along with Fighter jets or aircrafts in general, there were other things that HAL worked on building, they are car and, railways
- There were some giant displays of aerospace vehicles outside. 
- Got to see at some pictures as well as models from the projects like Tejas, Rohini, and lot more.
