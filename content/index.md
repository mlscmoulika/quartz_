To start off with, let me start by introducing myself. I am someone who believes that everyone has a Pheonix in them. Knowledge, life experiences, and a lot of other factors are responsible to help a person, experience rebirth of some kind. Rebirth is a new hope to achieve something for the good. Does that ring a bell? Did you have those moments too? If you had those moments, well atleast what I believed was right, and I am one among you! *A Pheonix* ! But if I am wrong, I think I would learn about it soon, because guess what I am an *explorer* too! ;) 

This is my personal blogging platform which would record the life experiences and learnings of this
